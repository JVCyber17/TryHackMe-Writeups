# TryHackMe- self study

Self-Directed Cybersecurity Learning via TryHackMe

Welcome to my learning repository. This space houses all my notes, write-ups, and documented knowledge acquired through my hands-on practice with TryHackMe.

My learning path is dual-focused, building a strong foundation in the essential skills and tools for two key areas:

* Offensive Security: Primarily focusing on Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT).

* Defensive Security: Centered on Security Operations Center (SOC) fundamentals and procedures.
